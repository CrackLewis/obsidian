Dear friend,

I hope this mail finds you well. I'm recommending to you one of my favorite movie, and I promise it's definitely worth your watching.

The title of the movie is Oppenheimer, a physicist who conducted the Manhattan project in the second World War, leading the invention and production of the first-generation nuclear weapon. The movie vividly depicts the entire course of the project along with his lifetime progress, explicitly conveying the call for peace and nuclear demilitarization. The depth and aesthetic appeal of the movie has gone so far beyond the majority of movies today, that I became instantly obsessed with the movie when I watched it two weeks ago.

Your watching and early reply at your convenience will be appreciated.

Best Regards,
Li Ming

Dear Friend,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to enthusiastically recommend one of my all-time favorite films, and I assure you that it is well worth your time.

The movie I am referring to is "Oppenheimer", a compelling portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist who played a pivotal role in the Manhattan Project during the Second World War. This project marked a significant chapter in history, as it led to the development and production of the first-generation nuclear weapon. "Oppenheimer" masterfully chronicles the entire trajectory of this project, intertwining it with Oppenheimer's life journey. Through its storytelling, the film skillfully conveys a powerful message advocating for peace and the demilitarization of nuclear weapons.

What sets this movie apart is its profound depth and unparalleled aesthetic appeal. It transcends the boundaries of contemporary cinema, leaving a lasting impact on anyone fortunate enough to experience it. Personally, I became utterly captivated by "Oppenheimer" when I watched it just two weeks ago.

I wholeheartedly encourage you to watch this remarkable film at your earliest convenience. I am confident that you will find it as compelling and thought-provoking as I did.

The drawing depicts a boat cruising in the water with a boatman rowing in the front and two passengers dropping litter onto the surface. Its title, the Residue of the Journey, massively enhanced its meaning and condemned such behavior.

It has hitherto become a common phenomenon that public areas, especially touring spots, are heavily littered on vacations due to the lack of ethic and responsibility by some tourists. The most obvious impact litter makes is the deterioration of the environment we live, negatively affecting the quality of civilians' daily life. The less obvious but more serious one, however, is the longlasting and irreversible damage to the biosphere. Since the biosphere is currently the only environment the humanity resides, continuously damaging it would lead to unthinkable consequences.

Garbage problems have existed for decades, and swift actions are essential to be taken before they engulf the entire planet. Besides necessary education on environmental protection and sustainable development, realistic projects like garbage classification and recycling are also adoptable options. To get the problem resolved and a litter-free world materialized, countries shall unite and deeply cooperate for a viable solution.

In this evocative illustration, we witness a serene scene marred by a disheartening display of irresponsibility. The artwork captures a boat gracefully gliding across the water, propelled by the diligent efforts of a boatman at the oars. However, the tranquility of the moment is shattered by the actions of two passengers who carelessly discard litter onto the water's surface. It is within this dichotomy that the title, "The Residue of the Journey," acquires its profound significance, shedding light on the urgent need to address such behavior and its consequences.

Regrettably, the **wanton disregard**（肆意漠视） for public spaces, particularly in popular tourist destinations, has become an **all-too-familiar**（司空见惯的） sight during vacations. This decline in ethical responsibility among certain tourists bears **stark repercussions**（严重影响）, the foremost being the degradation of the very environment we all share. This, in turn, **casts a shadow**（蒙上阴影） over the quality of life for inhabitants of these areas.

Yet, the more **insidious**（阴险的） consequence lies beneath the surface, in the long-lasting and potentially irreversible damage inflicted upon our fragile biosphere. The biosphere, as the sole habitat for humanity, is deserving of our utmost care and preservation. Repeatedly harming it jeopardizes the stability of ecosystems and poses unimaginable consequences for future generations.

The issue of waste management has **plagued**（困扰） societies for decades, and the time for decisive action is upon us, lest we allow it to engulf our entire planet. In addition to fostering a culture of environmental responsibility through education and sustainable development practices, we must embrace practical solutions like garbage classification and recycling programs. However, achieving a litter-free world necessitates international cooperation, as this is a problem that **transcends borders**（超越国界）. It calls for countries to unite, forging deep partnerships to formulate viable solutions and preserve the **sanctity**（神圣） of our planet for generations to come.
