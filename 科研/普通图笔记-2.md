*maximum clique problem* (MCP): given a simple undrct' graph $G$, return the maximum clique in $G$.

### sec01-intro

a naive sol': maintain all maximal cliques and return the largest one among them

conventional static MCP sol's:
- *PMC*: state-of-the-art approach
	- firstly, use a heuristic procedure to find a *seed* (a large clique denoted by $H$) based on core number
	- vtx's with core number lower than $|H|$ are pruned early
	- branch is bounded by a composite measure integrating k-core, graph coloring and branch size

seed acquisition in dyn' graphs:
- greedy approach: size not sufficient enough, computationally expensive
- observation:
	- the previous maximum clique $C_{\max}$ can generate a decent seed $H$ with low cost, such that $|C_{\max}|-1\le |H|\le |C_{\max}|$.
- *refreshing*: invocation of PMC to find a maximum clique based on $H$
	- called if necessary

contrib' in this paper:
- tight bound on $\omega(G')$, effn't seed acquisition from prev' maximum clique
- subtle strat' to reduce refreshing rate
- reduce refreshing overhead by reducing searching space
- new approach and analysis
