## 0-a survey of community search over big graphs

*community*: a group of vertices densely connected internally

community retrieval: find communities from large graphs

factors that retrieval solutions should satisfy: ^1a9310
- high efficiency, scalability, personalization, quality, and support dynamic graphs

*community search* (C.S.):
- goal: search high-quality comm.s in online manners based on queries

given a vtx $q\in G$, C.S. aims to find a community which contains $q$ and satisfies:
- connectivity: vtx.s in this comm. are connected
- cohesiveness (内聚性): vtx.s in the comm. are intensively linked to each other w.r.t. a *particular goodness metric* (特优度度量), the metric being defined by subgraph cohesiveness metrics such as:
	- $k$-core: largest possible $S\subseteq G$, in which $\forall v\in S, \deg(v)\ge k$
	- $k$-truss: largest possible $S\subseteq G$, in which $\forall e\in S$, e is contained by at least $k-2$ triangles within $S$
	- $k$-clique: a set of $k$ vtx.s in $G$ which forms a complete graph
	- $k$-ECC ($k$-edge-connected-component): a subgraph $S\subseteq G$ such that after removing any $k-1$ edges, it's still connected

*community detection* (C.D.):
- diff. with C.S.:
	- goals: C.S. searches comm.s based on queries, while C.D. detects all comm.s in graph
	- criteria: C.S. criteria are based on user-defined param.s, while C.D. uses the same global criterion
	- algorithms: C.S. soln.s are online, more efficient and scalable to big graphs, and can better satisfy the [[#^1a9310|factors above]]

C.S. solution classification: 
- five categories (four metrics and others)
- two groups: sol's on simple graphs; sol.s on attributed graphs (kw, loc, temporal, influence, profile)

P3/40

### sec02-preliminaries

- comm' cohesiveness metrics
- comparison of metrics' cohesiveness and computational efficiency

consider a simple undirected graph $G(V,E)$, in which $n=|V|,m=|E|$, and the degree of vtx $v$ is $\deg_G(v)$.

*k-core*: given graph $G$ and $k\ge 0$, the k-core of $G$, denoted by $H_k$, is the largest subgraph of $G$, such that $\forall v\in H_k, \deg_{H_k}(v)\ge k$. $k$ is called the order of $H_k$.
- if $i<j$, then $H_j\subseteq H_i$.
- $H_k$ might not be connected

*core number*: given $v\in V$, its core number, denoted by $\text{core}_G[v]$, is the highest order of a $k$-core that contains $v$.

![[Pasted image 20241019154452.png]]

e.g.: $H_3\subset H_2\subset H_1$. $H_1$ contains all vtx's except J. $\text{core}_G [E]$ is 2.

k-truss is defined based on triangles. A triangle in $G$ is a cycle of length 3 with all three vtx's on the cycle in $V$.

*support*: given $G(V,E)$, the support of an edge $e=(u,v)\in E$, denoted by $\text{sup}(e,G)$, is defined as $|\{\triangle_{uvw} : u,v,w\in V\}|$.

*k-truss*: given $G$ and $k\ge 2$, the $k$-truss of $G$, denoted by $J_k$, is the largest subgraph of $G$, such that $\forall e\in J_k$, $\text{sup}(e,J_k)\ge k-2$.
- k-truss might not be connected, just like k-core

*truss number*: given $G$, the truss number of $e\in G$, denoted by $\tau(e)$, is the largest $k$ such that $e\in J_k$.

e.g. (the graph above):
- $J_4=\{A,B,C,D\}$, $J_3=\{A,B,C,D,E\}$, $J_2=G$. 
- $\tau((A,B))=\tau((A,C))=4$, $\tau((A,E))=3$, $\tau((D,F))=2$.

*k-clique*: given $k\ge 2$, k-clique is a complete graph with $k$ vtx.s
- any edge is 2-clique, any triangle is 3-clique
- a $k$-clique has $\dfrac{k(k-1)}{2}$ edges

e.g. (the graph above): $\{A,B,C,D\}$ is a $4$-truss

*edge connectivity* (局部边连通度): given $G(V,E)$ and $u,v\in V$, the connectivity between $u,v$, denoted by $\lambda(u,v)$, is the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects $u$ and $v$.

*graph connectivity* (全局边连通度): given $G(V,E)$, the connectivity of $G$, denoted by $\lambda(G)$, is the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects $G$.
- $\lambda(G)=\min_{u,v\in V} \lambda(u,v)$

*k-ECC*: given $G(V,E)$, a subgraph $G'$ of $G$ is a k-edge-connected component, or a k-ECC, if $\lambda(G')\ge k$ and the connectivity of any super-graph of $G'$ in $G$ is less than $k$.

e.g. (still the graph above): $\{A,B,C,D\}$ is a 3-ECC of $G$. $\{A,B,C,D,E\}$ is a 2-ECC of $G$.

*comparison*:
- cohesiveness: k-clique>k-truss>k-ECC>k-core
	- inclusionship (包含关系): less operator means inclusion
		- k-clique\<k-truss, each CC of k-truss\<a k-ECC
		- k-truss\<(k-1)-core, k-ECC\<k-core
- computational efficiency:
	- k-core: time $O(m+n)$, space $O(m+n)$
	- k-ECC: time $O(h\cdot l\cdot m)$, space $O(m+n)$
	- k-truss: time $O(m^{1.5})$, space $O(m+n)$
	- k-clique: time $O(c(G)\cdot \sum_{l=2}^{k-1} N^l+k\cdot N^k)$, space $O(m+n)$
		- $c(G)$ is the maximum core number of vertices, $N^l$ is the number of $l$-cliques
	- comparison: k-core>k-ECC>k-truss>k-clique
- suggestion:
	- k-clique and k-truss for small graphs, k-core and k-ECC for larger graphs
	- k-truss is preferable to graphs with higher clustering coeff'nt and could be decomposed into more triangles, but not to special graphs with less or no triangles (such as trees, long loops)

### sec03-k-core based CS

undirected graphs, directed graphs, attributed graphs (keyword-based, location-based, temporal, influence value-based, profile-based)

#### CS on undirected graphs

*size-unbounded k-core CS on undirected graph*:

> [!problem] Prob. 1
> Given graph $G=(V,E)$, query $Q\subseteq V$ and a goodness function $f$, return a subgraph $H(V_H,E_H)$ of $G$ such that:
> - $Q\subseteq V_H$
> - $H$ is connected
> - $f(H)$ is maximized among all feasible choices for $H$

$f$ shall be larger if the graph is denser. a typical one is $f(H)=\min_{\forall v\in H} \deg_H(v)$, the *minimun degree* of $H$. other metrics include average degree and density, etc.

*Solution 1*: a global search algorithm (named *Global* specifically): 
- let $G_0=G$
- for all integer $1\le t<n$, $G_t$ is $G_{t-1}$ removing vtx's with the lowest degree
- if one of vtx's in $Q$ has the lowest deg in $G_{T-1}$, then stops at $T$-th step
- $H_i'$ are all connected component that contains $Q$ in $G_{T-1}$
- $H=\arg\max\{f(H_i')\}$
 
time $O(n+m)$, space $O(n+m)$, $H$ is a connected k-core

*Solution 2*: a local search algorithm (named *Local* specifically):
- assumes $Q=\{q\}$ has only one vtx, and expand search space from it
- generates a candidate vtx set $C$ in the search space:
	- selects a local optimal vtx $v$ using a specific *heuristic criterion*, a typical one being the vtx which leads to the largest increment of $f(C)$, another being the vtx which connects to most vtx's in $C$
	- add $v$ to $C$
	- iterate the two steps until $C$ satisfies the constraint of $H$
- find an optimal community $H$ from $C$

Global vs Local: suppose Global returns $H$ and Local returns $H'$:
- $f(H)=f(H'), H'\subseteq H$
- Local and Global has the same time complexity, but Local is usually more efficient

*Solution 3*: an index-based algorithm
- propose an index structure called *ShellStruct*, which organizes all connected k-cores in an offline manner
- *ShellStruct* is a tree-like structure built based on k-core nesting:
	- for any $1\le k\le k_{\max}$, $k$-core is a subgraph of a $(k-1)$-core
	- ShellStruct has $k$ levels, with nodes in $k$-th level corresponding to the $k$-core
	- $1$-core level is the root, and any node in the $k$-th level is a connected component of the $k$-core
	- the parent of a $k$-th level node is the $(k-1)$-core component it resides in
- index construction algorithm: time $O(m\cdot\alpha (n))$, where $\alpha(n)$ is the reverse Ackermann function which satisfies $\alpha(n)\le 5$ for all practical $n$.
- query algorithm: the $k$-core is the lowest common ancestor of all vtx's in $Q$. time $O(|H_V|)$.

a variant of Prob. 1, which allows less-connected vtx's to be involved:

> [!problem] Prob. 2
> Given $G(V,E)$, query vtx $q\in V$, integer $k\ge 0$, return a subgraph $H(V_H,E_H)$ of $G$, such that:
> - $q\in V_H$.
> - $H$ is connected.
> - for each $v\in V_H$, $\deg_H(v)\ge k$.

e.g. 

![[Pasted image 20241019154452.png]]

if this graph is $G$, then the $H$ from Prob.1 is $\{A,B,C,D\}$, while the $H$ from Prob.2 when $k=2,q=A$ is $\{A,B,C,D,E\}$.

*size-bounded k-core CS on undirected graph*:

in real applications, outputs are often required to be less than a size upperbound

drawback of Prob.1 and its sln's: it may return a large enough graph to breach the upperbound, even if we use *Local* sln'. 

another variant of Prob.1 but this time it's size-bounded:

> [!problem] Prob. 3
> Given $G(V,E)$, query vtx's $Q\subseteq V$, size constraint $k>0$, a goodness func $f$, return a subgraph $H(V_H,E_H)$ of $G$, such that:
> - $Q\subseteq V_H$
> - $H$ is connected
> - $|V_H|\le k$
> - $f(H)$ is maximized among all feasible choices of $H$

this is an NP-hard prob', meaning an exact algo' takes exponential time cost. but some heuristic algo's can achieve reasonable efficiency.

another variant of Prob. 1 to reduce vtx's:

> [!problem] Prob. 4
> Given $G(V,E)$, query vtx's $Q\subseteq V$, a minimum-deg-based func $f$. Let $H^*$ be the subgraph returned by Prob.1's *Global* sln'. Find a subgraph $H$ of $G$, such that:
> - $Q\subseteq V_H$, $H$ is conn'd
> - $f(H^*)=f(H)$
> - the size of $H$ is the smallest possible

Prob. 4 is also NP-hard, as it's more complex than Steiner tree prob', but an algo' is proposed to provide a "good enough" sol' with two steps:
- reduce $|H^*|$ as much as possible using local greedy search, making it smaller in size but still qualified for Prob.1
- find a subgraph of $H^*$ by adopting the above approximation algo' for the Steiner tree prob'

*Steiner tree problem*: given $G(V,E)$ and vtx's $Q\subseteq V$, return a graph $H(V_H,E_H)$ such that $Q\subseteq V_H$ and $|E_H|$ is minimized.
- above approx' algo': out of my brain capacity, see this [blog](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/684571642)

#### CS on directed graphs

for directed graph $G(V,E)$, all edges are directed. extra def's:
- in-degree of $v$ is denoted by $\deg_G^{in}(v)$ and out-degree is denoted by $\deg_{G}^{out}(v)$.
- min in-deg of $G$ is denoted by $\delta_{in}(G)$, and min out-deg is denoted by $\lambda_{out}(G)$

![[Pasted image 20241020201750.png]]

an obvious sol' to CS on drct' graphs is to *ignore directions* and transfer it to CS on undrct' graphs. def:

*(k, l)-core*: given drct' graph $G(V,E)$, and integers $k\ge 0,l\ge 0$, the (k-l)-core of $G$ is the maximum subgraph $C$ of $G$ such that $\delta_{in}(C)\ge k$ and $\delta_{out}(C)\ge l$.

based on it Prob.5 is issued (named *CSD*):

> [!problem] Prob. 5
> Given a drct' graph $G(V,E)$, integers $k> 0,l> 0$, and a query vtx $q\in V$, return a connected subgraph $G_q\subseteq G$, such that:
> - $q\in G_q$
> - $\forall v\in G_q$, $\delta_{in}(G_q)\ge k$ and $\delta_{out}(G_q)\ge l$.

e.g. in fig. (b), $\{A,B,C\}$ is a 2-core of $G$.

![[Pasted image 20241020201750.png]]

a sol' to *CSD* similar to *Global* in undrct' graph CS:
- peel vtx's until the remaining satisfies the constraints
- time $O(m+n)$, might be inefficient for large graphs
- index-based optimization:
	- perform D-core decompositions first, calculating all (k,l)-cores and lay them out in a table
	- answer the query using the table index
	- overall space cost could be $O(m)$ using key observation

P9/40

#### CS on keyword-based attributed graphs

kwbag' = keyword-based attributed graph

a *keyword-based attributed graph* $G$ is an undrct' graph $G$, whose vtx's are associated with a set of *keywords*, denoted by $W(v)$.

![[Pasted image 20241020211600.png]]

Prob. 6 (namely *ACQ*):

> [!problem] Prob. 6
> Given an kwbag' $G(V,E)$, int' $k>0$, vtx $q\in V$, and a set of kw's $S\subseteq W(q)$. Return a set $H$ of subgraphs of $G$, such that for all $G_q\in H$, the following properties hold:
> - connectivity: $q\in G_q$, and $G_q$ is conn'd
> - structure cohesiveness: $\forall v\in G_q$, $\deg_{G_q}(v)\ge k$
> - keyword cohesiveness: $L(G_q,S)=\bigcap_{v\in G_q} (W(v)\cap S)$ is maximal, which marks the common kw. within $G_q$

e.g. in fig(a) above, if $q=A,k=2,S=\{w,x,y\}$, then output of Prob.6 is all subsets of  $\{A,C,D\}$, indicating that they share the kw' $x,y$.

each $G_q$ is called an *attributed community* (A.C.) of $q$, and $L(G_q,S)$ is the *AC-label* of $G_q$. 

two outstanding features of ACQ:
- ease of interpretation: AC contains tightly conn'd vtx's with similar contexts
- personalization: by specifying $S$, user can control AC's semantics

a sol' to ACQ:
- steps:
	- all non-empty subsets of $S$ are enumerated
	- for each subset $S_i$ ($1\le i\le 2^l-1$), check whether there is a subgraph satisfying the first two properties (conn'ty, structure coh'ness)
	- output the subgraphs having the most shared kw's
- *anti-monotonicity property* (反单调性): given $S$, if it appears in every vtx' of an AC, then all of $S'\subseteq S$ appears in them too, so a lot of subsets $S_i$ can be pruned

*CL-tree*: an index proposed for organizing the vtx' kw' data hierarchically
- the structure is like ShellStruct, but for each node $p$, an inverted list is maintained to store all kw' appearing in the vtx' of $p$
- space cost $O(\hat{l}\cdot n)$, where $\hat{l}=\sum_{v\in G} |W(v)|/|V|$ denotes the average kw' count each vtx' has
- time cost $O(\alpha(n)\cdot m)$

e.g. fig(b) presents the CL-tree index of $G$ in fig(a)

![[Pasted image 20241021135902.png]]

#### CS on location-based attributed graphs

a *location-based attributed graph* (基于位置的属性图), a.k.a. *geo-social network*, is an undrct' graph $G(V,E)$. for each vtx' $v\in V$, it has a location position $(v.x,v.y)$, denoting its positions along the $x,y$-axis respectively.

e.g. a simple geo-social network

![[Pasted image 20241021141056.png]]

three kinds of CS on geo-soc' nw' studied:
- *spatial-aware community* (SAC) search
- *radius-bounded k-core* (RB-k-core) search
- *geo-social group queries* with minimum acquaintance constraints (GSGQ)
- comparison:
	- all adopt k-core model, all require comm' to be spatially cohesive
	- spatial cohesiveness criteria differ: SAC uses smallest minimum covering circle (MCC), RB-k-core uses radius-fixed covering circle, and GSGQ uses center-fixed rectangles or circles

*SAC search*:

*minimum covering circle* (MCC, 最小覆盖圆): given a set $S$ of vtx's with loc's, the MCC of $S$ is the spatial circle containing all the vtx's in $S$ with the smallest radius

SAC search can be desc'd as Prob.7:

> [!problem] Prob. 7
> Given a geo-social nw' $G(V,E)$, int' $k>0$, and a vtx' $q\in V$, return a subgraph $G_q\subseteq G$, and the following properties hold:
> - connectivity: $q\in G_q$, $G_q$ is conn'd
> - structure cohesiveness: $\forall v\in G_q$, $\deg_{G_q}(v)\ge k$
> - spatial cohesiveness: the MCC of vtx's in $G_q$ has the smallest radius

the first two prop' forms a feasible sol', the third one forms the optimal sol', denoted by $\Psi$ (MCC radius denoted by $r_{opt}$). 

e.g. 

![[Pasted image 20241021141056.png]]

for $q=Q,k=2$, two subgraphs $\{Q,A,B\}$, $\{Q,C,D\}$ satisfies first two prop's. but the former $r=\sqrt{13}/2$, the latter $r=3/2$, so $\Psi=\{Q,C,D\}$.

the exact sol' time is $O(m\times n^3)$, which is impractical in real app's

approximation ratio: how many times the result circle radius is larger than $r_{opt}$

*AppInc*: an approx' algo' to solve Prob.7
- for given $q,k$, returns the feasible sol' in a circ' $O(q,\delta)$ (centers in $q$ and the radius is $\delta$). for fig' above, it returns $\{Q,A,B\}$, $\delta=2$.
- $\delta$ is approx'ed thru' binary search

*AppAcc*: 
- AppInc $\delta$ is around $(2+\epsilon)r_{opt}$. AppAcc aims to optimize $\delta$ further, reducing it to lower than $2r_{opt}$
- locate the area containing $\Psi$'s center first, then approx' the center by splitting area into grids, and find an approx' sol' using grids finally

trade-off between approx' ratio & effn'

*RB-k-core search*:

as defined in Prob.8:

> [!problem] Prob. 8
> Given a geo-social nw' $G(V,E)$, $k>0$, a radius $r>0$, and a vtx' $q\in V$, return all the subgraphs $G_q\subseteq G$, and the following properties hold:
> - connectivity: $q\in G_q$, $G_q$ is conn'd
> - structure cohesiveness: $\forall v\in G_q$, $\deg_{G_q}(v)\ge k$.
> - spatial cohesiveness: the MCC of vtx's in $G_q$ has a radius $r'\le r$.
> - maximality constraint: there exists no other subgraph $G_q'$ satisfying prop's above and $G_q\subset G_q'$

three sol's to RB-k-core search:
- *TriV*: a triple-vtx'-based algo' based on observations that three vtx's can determine a circle
	- propose to generate all candidate circles containing $q$, and compute the maximum k-core for subgraphs contained in the candidate circles with $r'\le r$
	- time $O(mn^3)$, $m$ denotes the time to verify each circle
- *BinV*: an optimization to TriV
	- only circles with $r'=r$ and containing $q$ are generated
	- for each pair of vtx's, at most 2 circles are generated, so time can be optim'd to $O(mn^2)$
- *RotC*: a rotating-circ'-based algo' to reuse the intermediate computation results in finding RB-k-cores
	- fix each vtx' $v\in V$ as a pole, and generate circ's in a rotating way so the computation cost is shared among adjacent circ's
	- some pruning techniques to terminate invalid circ's

P11/40

*geo-social group queries with minimum acquaintance constraint* (GSGQ):

as defined in Prob. 9:

> [!problem] Prob. 9
> Given a geo-social nw' $G(V,E)$, a vtx' $q\in V$, int' $k>0$, and a spatial constraint $\Lambda$. return a subgraph $G_q\subseteq G$, and the following constraints hold:
> - connectivity: $q\in G_q$, $G_q$ is conn'd
> - structure cohesiveness: $\forall v\in G_q$, $\deg_{G_q}(v)\ge k$
> - spatial cohesiveness: $G_q$ satisfies constraint $\Lambda$
> - maximality constraint: no other subgraph $G_q'$ exist to satisfy prop's above and $G_q\subset G_q'$.

spatial constraint $\Lambda$ could be one of the three following:
- a spatial rectangle for containing $G_q$
- a circ' centered in $q$ with radius $r\le r_k$, $r_k$ denoting the distance from $q$ to its $k$-th nearest vtx' in $G_q$ ($G_q$ might have more than $(k+1)$ vtx's)
- a circ' satisfying the previous constraint and $G_q$ contains exactly $(k+1)$ vtx's

using *R-tree index*, Prob.9 satisfying different $\Lambda$ could be solved:
- first one only: $O(n+m)$
- second one only: $O(n(n+m))$
- second+third: $O(C_k^{n-1} (m+n))$

social-aware R-trees (*SaR-tree*) index:
- incorporates both vtx's spatial and social locations
- built based on the concept of core bounding rectanle (*CBR*), which projects the minimum degree constraint on the spatial layer
	- CBR of vtx $v$ is a rectangle containing $v$, inside which any vtx' group with $v$ doesn't satisfy the minimum degree constraint
- SaR-tree vs R-tree:
	- each entry of SaR-tree refers to a set of CBRs and a minimum bounding rectangle (*MBR*)
		- CBR bounds vtx's from social perspective, while MBR bound 'em from spatial perspective
	- SaR-tree can gain power for both social- and spatial-based pruning
- *SaR\*-tree*: a variant which optim' the group of spatial obj's to minimize the disk I/O cost

#### CS on temporal graphs

a *temporal graph* (时态图) is an undrct' graph $G(V,E)$. each edge $e\in E$ is a triplet $e=(u,v,t)$, where $u,v$ are vtx's in $V$ and $t$ is the interaction time btwn' $u,v$.

the projected graph $G_p$ over the time interval $[t_s,t_e]$ is def'd as $G_p=(V,E,[t_s,t_e])$, where $V=V(E)$, $E=\{(u,v)|(u,v,t)\in E(G), t\in[t_s,t_e]\}$. 

e.g. 

![[Pasted image 20241022125314.png]]

def's:

*maximal (θ-k)-persistent-core interval* (最大(θ-k)-持续核心间隔): given a temporal graph $G=(V,E)$ and param' $\theta>0,k>0$, an interval $[t_s,t_e]$ with $t_e-t_s\ge \theta$ is called a maximal (θ-k)-persistent-core interval for $G$ iff the following two cond's hold:
- for any $t\in [t_s,t_e-\theta]$, the projected graph of $G$ over $[t,t+\theta]$ is a connected k-core.
- there is no super-interval of $[t_s,t_e]$ such that the previous cond' hold.

说人话：让时态图在任何$\theta$时间内投影达到k-core要求的一个最长时间段，区间超了就达不到k-core要求了

*core persistence* (核心持久度): let $T=\{[t_{s_1},t_{e_1}],[t_{s_2},t_{e_2}],\ldots,[t_{s_r},t_{e_r}]\}$ be the set of all maximal $(\theta,k)$-persistent-core intervals of $G$. the core persistence of $G$ with param' $\theta,k$, denoted by $F(\theta,k,G)$ is def'd as:
$$
F(\theta,k,G)=\left\{\begin{matrix}
\sum_{i=1}^r (t_{e_i}-t_{s_i}) - (r-1)\theta, & if\ T\neq\varnothing, \\
0, & otherwise.
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

说人话：一个时态图可能有多个时段的投影都满足k-core性质。这些时段的溢出总和即为core persistence.

*(θ,τ)-persistent k-core* ((θ-τ)-持久的k-core): given a temporal graph $G$ and param's $\theta,\tau,k$, a (θ-τ)-persistent k-core is an induced temporal subgraph $C=(V_C,E_C)$ meeting the following prop's:
- persistent-core property: $F(\theta,k,C)\ge \tau$.
- maximal property: there doesn't exist an induced temporal subgraph $C'$ that contains $C$ and also satisfies the persistent-core prop'

CS on temporal graphs can be def'd as the *persistent community search* prob' as Prob.10:

> [!problem] Prob. 10
> Given a temporal graph $G$ and param's $\theta,\tau,k$, find the largest $(\theta,\tau)$-persistent k-core in $G$.

e.g.

![[Pasted image 20241022125314.png]]

assume $\theta=3,k=2$:
- there's no maximal $(3,2)$-persistent-core interval for $G$.
- there is a maximal $(3,2)$-persistent-core interval $[1,5]$ for $C=\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$.
- let $\tau=4$, then $\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ is a $(3,4)$-persistent 2-core.

这块没咋懂（P12左下，建议重读）

Prob.10 is NP-hard, so a prune-and-search approach is proposed:
- pruning phase: temporal graph reduction algo' which decomposes the whole time span of the temporal graph into meta-intervals
- searching phase: a branch-and-bound algo' with several pruning rules which finds the maximum $(\theta,\tau)$-persistent k-core

#### CS on influence value-based attributed graphs

##### single-dimensional influential CS

an influential CS prob': 
- given an undrct' graph $G(V,E)$, each vtx' $v\in V$ is assoc'd with a weight $w_v$ indicating the influence of $v$.
- without loss of generality, it's assumed that $\forall 1\le i,j\le n,i\neq j, w_i\neq w_j$.

def's:

*influence value of a subgraph* (子图影响值): given an undrct' graph $G(V,E)$ and an induced subgraph $H(V_H,E_H)$ of $G$. the influence value of $H$ denoted by $f(H)$ is:
$$
f(H)=\min_{u\in V_H}\{w_u\}
$$

*k-influential community* (k-影响社区): given an undrct' graph $G(V,E)$ and int' $k$, a $k$-influential community is an induced subgraph $H^k=(V_H^k,E_H^k)$ of $G$ that meets all the following constraints:
- conn'ty: $H^k$ is conn'd
- cohesiveness: each vtx' $u$ in $H^k$ has deg' at least $k$
- maximal structure: no other idc'd subgraph $\overset{\sim}{H}$ containing $H^k$ exists to satisfy the previous constraints

*non-contained k-influential community*: given $G(V,E)$ and $k$, a non-contained k-influential comm'ty $H^k=(V_H^k,E_H^k)$ is a k-influential comm'ty that meets:
- non-containment: $H^k$ can't contain a k-influential comm'ty $\overset{\_}{H^k}$ such that $f(\overset{\_}{H^k})>f(H^k)$. 

e.g.

suppose $k=2$:
- $\{v_{12},v_{13},v_{14},v_{15}\}$ is a 2-influential comm'ty with influence value 12
- $\{v_{12},v_{14},v_{15}\}$ is NOT any influential comm'ty
- $\{v_3,v_4,v_5\}$, $\{v_8,v_9,v_{11}\}$ and $\{v_{13},v_{14},v_{15}\}$ are non-contained 2-influential comm'ties
- $\{v_{12},v_{13},v_{14},v_{15}\}$ is NOT a non-contained 2-influential comm'ty

*top-r k-influential CS problem* (desc'd in Prob.11):

> [!problem] Prob. 11
> Given $G(V,E)$ and param's $k,r$, find the top-$r$ $k$-influential comm's with the highest influence value.

*top-r non-contained k-influential CS problem* (desc'd in Prob.12):

> [!problem] Prob. 12
> Given $G(V,E)$ and param's $k,r$, find the top-r non-contained k-influential comm'ties with the highest influence value.

Prob.11 and Prob.12 sol's:
- online search algo's:
	- an online algo': remove a k-influential comm'ty in each iteration (the comm'ty contains the vtx' having the lowest influence in $G$). the last $r$ iterations yield the top-$r$ k-influential comm'ties
	-
