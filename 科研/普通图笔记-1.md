## 0-a survey of community search over big graphs

*community*: a group of vertices densely connected internally

community retrieval: find communities from large graphs

factors that retrieval solutions should satisfy: ^1a9310
- high efficiency, scalability, personalization, quality, and support dynamic graphs

*community search* (C.S.):
- goal: search high-quality comm.s in online manners based on queries

given a vtx $q\in G$, C.S. aims to find a community which contains $q$ and satisfies:
- connectivity: vtx.s in this comm. are connected
- cohesiveness (内聚性): vtx.s in the comm. are intensively linked to each other w.r.t. a *particular goodness metric* (特优度度量), the metric being defined by subgraph cohesiveness metrics such as:
	- $k$-core: largest possible $S\subseteq G$, in which $\forall v\in S, \deg(v)\ge k$
	- $k$-truss: largest possible $S\subseteq G$, in which $\forall e\in S$, e is contained by at least $k-2$ triangles within $S$
	- $k$-clique: a set of $k$ vtx.s in $G$ which forms a complete graph
	- $k$-ECC ($k$-edge-connected-component): a subgraph $S\subseteq G$ such that after removing any $k-1$ edges, it's still connected

*community detection* (C.D.):
- diff. with C.S.:
	- goals: C.S. searches comm.s based on queries, while C.D. detects all comm.s in graph
	- criteria: C.S. criteria are based on user-defined param.s, while C.D. uses the same global criterion
	- algorithms: C.S. soln.s are online, more efficient and scalable to big graphs, and can better satisfy the [[#^1a9310|factors above]]

C.S. solution classification: 
- five categories (four metrics and others)
- two groups: sol's on simple graphs; sol.s on attributed graphs (kw, loc, temporal, influence, profile)

### sec02-preliminaries

- comm' cohesiveness metrics
- comparison of metrics' cohesiveness and computational efficiency

consider a simple undirected graph $G(V,E)$, in which $n=|V|,m=|E|$, and the degree of vtx $v$ is $\deg_G(v)$.

*k-core*: given graph $G$ and $k\ge 0$, the k-core of $G$, denoted by $H_k$, is the largest subgraph of $G$, such that $\forall v\in H_k, \deg_{H_k}(v)\ge k$. $k$ is called the order of $H_k$.
- if $i<j$, then $H_j\subseteq H_i$.
- $H_k$ might not be connected

*core number*: given $v\in V$, its core number, denoted by $\text{core}_G[v]$, is the highest order of a $k$-core that contains $v$.

e.g.: $H_3\subset H_2\subset H_1$. $H_1$ contains all vtx's except J. $\text{core}_G [E]$ is 2.

k-truss is defined based on triangles. A triangle in $G$ is a cycle of length 3 with all three vtx's on the cycle in $V$.

*support*: given $G(V,E)$, the support of an edge $e=(u,v)\in E$, denoted by $\text{sup}(e,G)$, is defined as $|\{\triangle_{uvw} : u,v,w\in V\}|$.

*k-truss*: given $G$ and $k\ge 2$, the $k$-truss of $G$, denoted by $J_k$, is the largest subgraph of $G$, such that $\forall e\in J_k$, $\text{sup}(e,J_k)\ge k-2$.
- k-truss might not be connected, just like k-core

*truss number*: given $G$, the truss number of $e\in G$, denoted by $\tau(e)$, is the largest $k$ such that $e\in J_k$.

e.g. (the graph above):
- $J_4=\{A,B,C,D\}$, $J_3=\{A,B,C,D,E\}$, $J_2=G$. 
- $\tau((A,B))=\tau((A,C))=4$, $\tau((A,E))=3$, $\tau((D,F))=2$.

*k-clique*: given $k\ge 2$, k-clique is a complete graph with $k$ vtx.s
- any edge is 2-clique, any triangle is 3-clique
- a $k$-clique has $\dfrac{k(k-1)}{2}$ edges

e.g. (the graph above): $\{A,B,C,D\}$ is a $4$-truss

*edge connectivity* (局部边连通度): given $G(V,E)$ and $u,v\in V$, the connectivity between $u,v$, denoted by $\lambda(u,v)$, is the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects $u$ and $v$.

*graph connectivity* (全局边连通度): given $G(V,E)$, the connectivity of $G$, denoted by $\lambda(G)$, is the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects $G$.
- $\lambda(G)=\min_{u,v\in V} \lambda(u,v)$

*k-ECC*: given $G(V,E)$, a subgraph $G'$ of $G$ is a k-edge-connected component, or a k-ECC, if $\lambda(G')\ge k$ and the connectivity of any super-graph of $G'$ in $G$ is less than $k$.

e.g. (still the graph above): $\{A,B,C,D\}$ is a 3-ECC of $G$. $\{A,B,C,D,E\}$ is a 2-ECC of $G$.

*comparison*:
- cohesiveness: k-clique>k-truss>k-ECC>k-core
	- inclusionship (包含关系): less operator means inclusion
		- k-clique\<k-truss, each CC of k-truss\<a k-ECC
		- k-truss\<(k-1)-core, k-ECC\<k-core
- computational efficiency:
	- k-core: time $O(m+n)$, space $O(m+n)$
	- k-ECC: time $O(h\cdot l\cdot m)$, space $O(m+n)$
	- k-truss: time $O(m^{1.5})$, space $O(m+n)$
	- k-clique: time $O(c(G)\cdot \sum_{l=2}^{k-1} N^l+k\cdot N^k)$, space $O(m+n)$
		- $c(G)$ is the maximum core number of vertices, $N^l$ is the number of $l$-cliques
	- comparison: k-core>k-ECC>k-truss>k-clique
- suggestion:
	- k-clique and k-truss for small graphs, k-core and k-ECC for larger graphs
	- k-truss is preferable to graphs with higher clustering coeff'nt and could be decomposed into more triangles, but not to special graphs with less or no triangles (such as trees, long loops)
