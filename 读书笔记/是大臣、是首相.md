Sir Arnold: It's *the law of inverse relevance*（逆相关的准则）, the less you intend to do about something, the more you have to keep talking about it.

HA: Knowledge only means complicity（阴谋） and guilt, ignorance has a certain dignity.

SPEECH: The Burandans feel a special *affinity*（亲和力） with the Celtic peoples in their struggles for freedom. We too had to fight to break free from the chains of British colonialism.

HA: Well, if we do nothing, we implicitly agree with the speech. Two, if we issue a statement, we just look foolish. Three, if we lodge a protest, it will be ignored. Four, we can't cut off aid, because we didn't give them any. Five, if we break off diplomatic relations, we can't negotiate the oil rig contracts. And six, if we declare war, it might just look as if we were overreacting.
