## YM1-1 Open Government

librium 安定药

JH: Fingers crossed. 祈祷吧。

Narrator: Top tip for the DAA is Jim Hacker. 行政大臣是吉姆哈克。

JH: I'm sure you'll be just the thing. 我相信你能胜任。

BW: Minister, allow me to present Sir HA, Perm. Und. Sec. of State and Head of the DAA.

Sir Arnold: It's *the law of inverse relevance*（逆相关的准则）, the less you intend to do about something, the more you have to keep taling about it.

HA: Knowledge only means complicity（阴谋） and guilt, ignorance has a certain dignity.

HA: Everyone of them would have been a *laughing stock*（笑柄） in three months, had it not been for the most rigid and impenetrable secrecy about *what they were up to*（他们的所作所为）.

invoice 采购发票

computer peripheral 计算机外部设备

scandalous 可耻的

JH: It's about time they were *jolted*（摇动，唤醒） out of their commercial *complacency*（自满）.

up to the hilt 最大限度地

JH: So we're *being fobbed off*（欺骗） with second rate American junk by smart Aleck salesman from Pittsburgh while British factories stand empty and British workmen queue up for the *dole*（救济品）.

HA: I'm sorry to burst in like this, but all hell's just broken loose at No. 10. 很抱歉这样闯进来，但首相府已经乱套了。

clearance 审查

HA: The PM giveth and the PM taketh away. 首相赋予你一切，也可以夺走一切。

HA: Blessed be the name of the PM. 希望首相心慈手软。

Vic Gould: You really are *a pain in the ass*（麻烦精）. The PM is going up the wall, *hitting up the roof*（火冒三丈）!

gaping 豁开的，裂开的

with tact and finess 机巧地

HA: You mean within the framework of the guidelines about open government that you have laid down, you're suggesting that we should adopt a more flexible posture?
