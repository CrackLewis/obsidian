Greetings, professors. My name is Li Boyu, I'm a fourth-year undergraduate from Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province. I've majored in computer science in Tongji University since September 2020. I'll introduce myself in my past experience, preparations and my future plan.

During the last three years, I've completed all courses and obtained a GPA of 4.3 out of 5. I have good English capabilities and achieved a high score in CET6. I can also read papers efficiently and do paper writing with LaTeX, which will help a lot in my future research. Beside that, I actively improved my programming skill, took place in various programming competitions, such as ICPC, CCPC, and obtained several medals.

I decide to take the postgraduate entrance exam for Peking University not only to continue my studies, but also to strive for an opportunity to cooperate with your school and make progress in the field of computer science. I put a whole year into the full preparation, and I deeply believe I'm qualified enough to apply for admission into your school.

If I'm fortunately admitted, I'll dedicate my next three years to the study of the software engineering subject, especially the field of operating systems and distributed systems. And after my graduation, I want to be a versatile talent with technical skills and academic quality.

That's all for my self-introduction, thank you.
