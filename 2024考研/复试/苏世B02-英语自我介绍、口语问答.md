Greetings, professors. My name is Li Boyu, coming from Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province. I've majored in computer science in Tongji University since September 2020. I'll introduce myself in my past experience, preparations and my future plan.

During the last three years, I've completed all courses and obtained a GPA of 4.3 out of 5. I have good English capabilities and achieved a high score in CET6. Also I can read

That's all for my self-introduction, thank you.
