The drawing portrays two persons reacting with different attitudes towards a spilling bottle, one pitying in grief for the mess while the other being grateful for the remaining liquid and attempting to prevent it from spilling out more. It conveys the idea that more optimistic attitudes could reduce loss and carry people through frustration.

Attitudes could be classified into optimistic and pessimistic ones depending on how active it is. In most circumstances, optimistic attitudes help relieve our pain and put ourselves together in face of unfavorable conditions. Individuals with such attitudes like Abraham Lincoln and Steve Jobs eventually succeeded in their fields after numerous failures. In social activities, positive persons like Donald Trump tend to gain more attention than their less positive counterpart.

From my perspective, whether to keep optimistic about the bottle or not is the reason the two persons in the drawing acted so differently. Beside enhancing the attitudes' influence on the consequence, the drawing also encourages us to always look into the bright side in any possible circumstance for a better outcome.
